# Project Title: A food order application (**MoreHungry**)

## What will the application do?

*MoreHungry*  is an application that will:
- display food selections available for order
- display current order balance
- make recommendation or suggestions when needed


## Who will use it?
*MoreHungry* is intended for restaurants owners:
- who need simple graphical interfaces for 
customers to order food
- whose customers will be able to use it to order food and
know how much to pay, wait time, etc.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

Since restaurants are everywhere and is part of our
living. I would like to make an application that 
might have usage in our daily living. 


## *User Stories*
- As a user: I want to know what selections of food item
  is available and the price when I try to place an order
- As a user: I want to add item again and again if wanted to
- As a user: I want to be able to cancel items 
- As a user: I want to be able to see the quantities
  of items ordered and the total price at the moment   
- As a user: I want to be able to save my orders history
- As a user: I also want to be able to reload my order history, so that 
  next time I could re-order the same types of items if wanted to
